Hello and welcome to the RailsGirlsNL project!

The RailsGirlsNL project has been started as a project for alumni of Dutch RailsGirls events to work on to get more experience programming, and to have a project to focus their learning on.
The project is meant to be the platform for RailsGirls to find resources, connect to one another, share code and do much more.
Any ideas for making the website even more useful for RailsGirls are very welcome!
